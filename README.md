  - Is to use this repository as if it were a notebook, and course repository. There will be all the exercises and a mini-blog with all the activities done by me during the course.


## "Tap into a talent pool that spans multiple regions and multiple countries. The best engineers aren‚Äôt always in your backyard. " - Andela.


So my goal is to make the most of the course, network, share all the knowledge gained, and more.
